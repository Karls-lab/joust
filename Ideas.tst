So at first, make a 1 to 1 clone of joust. Add the original sounds in too! That would be so dope.

Afterwards, like maybe after wave 4, create some epic sounds and powers! Like maybe an extra long stick, 
a forcefield, or maybe a lazer beam. After that, maybe even a jump boost.
Also, make some cool as final boses. Like a dragon that shoot fire down a lane.
