Current DevOps:

Enemies: 
   Enemies are working pretty well! I'm happy with the progress I've made

Main Menu:
   All the display text will be reneder withing the menu class, but

   I should create a file for highscores, make it secure 
   and tamper proof.  


Assets:

   The levels I create are too repatable, so I need a way to 
   randomize it a little bit and to make it progressivly more harder, 
   while still shorter and modular. Remember DRY. Do not repeat yourself.
